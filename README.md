Registration Form Project:

This project is part of my internship at Bharat Intern. The goal of Task 1 was to develop a registration form using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB.

Overview:

This project implements a basic registration form that captures user details and stores them in a MongoDB database. It is a full stack application that demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS for the front end, Node.js for the back end, and MongoDB for the database.


Technologies Used:

HTML: For the structure of the form.
CSS: For styling the form.
Node.js: For the server-side logic.
MongoDB: For the database to store user details.
